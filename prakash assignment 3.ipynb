      "Was a bit confusing to find since there is another location of this chain only a couple streets over with a very similar name (Smart Hyde Park Inn). This location seemed nicer than the other one based on the reception. Room was clean and nice. Ensuite bathroom was very tiny, but I had the room to myself, so not a problem for me. No sound-proofing in room though, so could hear everyone's conversations as they were waiting for the lift or using the shared bathroom. Easy walk to tube station.\n",
